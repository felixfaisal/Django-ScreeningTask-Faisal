1
00:00:02,682 --> 00:00:05,726
Not all science is created equal.

2
00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:09,146
There's physics, the
undisputed king of science.

3
00:00:09,148 --> 00:00:10,931
There's chemistry. It's no physics,

4
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:13,368
but it's not a bad way
to pass a rainy afternoon.

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,997
And then there's biology,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,239
the squishiest of the sciences.

7
00:00:18,242 --> 00:00:19,387
Ugh!

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,942
Once you have deposited enough saliva

9
00:00:21,944 --> 00:00:23,723
in the blue Benedict's solution,

10
00:00:23,726 --> 00:00:25,206
we'll mix it

11
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,599
in the centrifuge.

12
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:29,012
After that, we'll pass it
through the spectrometer

13
00:00:29,015 --> 00:00:31,342
to measure how much glucose is present.

14
00:00:31,344 --> 00:00:33,562
And won't that be a party?

15
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:34,783
Sheldon.

16
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:53,715
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

17
00:00:53,718 --> 00:00:55,586
It's warm. Oh, dear.

18
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:14,109

19
00:01:15,664 --> 00:01:17,911
And then there was some
extra money in the budget,

20
00:01:17,913 --> 00:01:19,652
so I was able to order
those tackling dummies

21
00:01:19,654 --> 00:01:21,175
I had my eye on.

22
00:01:21,177 --> 00:01:23,090
I don't understand why
the football program gets

23
00:01:23,092 --> 00:01:25,270
so much money, while the
equipment in the science lab

24
00:01:25,273 --> 00:01:27,094
is outdated and falling apart.

25
00:01:27,096 --> 00:01:28,312
Oh, I can explain that.

26
00:01:28,314 --> 00:01:29,575
This is Texas.

27
00:01:29,577 --> 00:01:30,576
Pass the ribs.

28
00:01:30,578 --> 00:01:32,492
Well, it's not fair. It's a school.

29
00:01:32,495 --> 00:01:34,449
Education should be their priority.

30
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:36,059
All right, I'll explain it again...

31
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:37,614
I think Shelly's got a point.

32
00:01:37,617 --> 00:01:39,715
The school is supposed
to prepare these kids

33
00:01:39,717 --> 00:01:41,108
for the future. How many of 'em

34
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,545
are gonna be professional
football players?

35
00:01:43,547 --> 00:01:45,112
No one at this table.

36
00:01:45,114 --> 00:01:47,984
But how many of 'em
are gonna be scientists?

37
00:01:47,986 --> 00:01:49,246
I know.

38
00:01:49,249 --> 00:01:51,438
George, isn't there a
way they can take some

39
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:53,815
of the football money
and spend it on science?

40
00:01:53,818 --> 00:01:55,687
Really? I need to explain it again?

41
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,167
You know, Moon Pie, in the
'60s, when the hippies wanted

42
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,693
to change things, they
would just protest.

43
00:02:00,695 --> 00:02:02,477
- You were a hippie?
- Oh, no.

44
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,871
But I wrote a letter
complaining about the hippies,

45
00:02:04,873 --> 00:02:07,235
and the police chased 'em
right out of that park.

46
00:02:07,238 --> 00:02:08,715
So my point is...

47
00:02:08,718 --> 00:02:10,616
maybe you could write a letter.

48
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:13,009
Ooh! Maybe I can lodge
a formal complaint

49
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:15,185
with the school board about
the sports budget infringing

50
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:16,535
on the other departments.

51
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:17,666
Okay, last time:

52
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:19,189
Canada,

53
00:02:19,191 --> 00:02:21,017
the other states,

54
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:22,602
us.

55
00:02:30,463 --> 00:02:32,638
What are you doing, standing there?

56
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,814
I wrote a formal complaint
letter to the school board

57
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:36,903
on how much money is spent on football.

58
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:39,166
I was hoping you could
deliver it to them.

59
00:02:39,168 --> 00:02:41,081
You do realize your
father's a coach here.

60
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,430
Yes, sir, I do.

61
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:44,432
Maybe you ought to talk
to him about this first.

62
00:02:44,434 --> 00:02:45,476
I did.

63
00:02:45,478 --> 00:02:47,348
He didn't care for the idea at all.

64
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,698
Well, there you go.

65
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,528
There I go what?

66
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,267
Let me see that.

67
00:02:56,141 --> 00:02:59,360
"Barbaric sport...
encourages bloodlust similar

68
00:02:59,362 --> 00:03:01,125
to Roman gladiator games...

69
00:03:01,128 --> 00:03:03,320
Christians, lions...

70
00:03:03,322 --> 00:03:05,671
money better spent on
science and learning."

71
00:03:05,673 --> 00:03:07,430
You're joking, right?

72
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:10,155
Did you see the word "bazinga"
anywhere in that letter?

73
00:03:14,116 --> 00:03:15,463
Out.

74
00:03:15,465 --> 00:03:18,337
I'll just have to go over his head.

75
00:03:21,557 --> 00:03:23,688
President Cooper.

76
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:25,526
That's serendipitous.

77
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,257
Hello.

78
00:03:29,697 --> 00:03:31,174
What?

79
00:03:31,176 --> 00:03:33,829
I understand that you're in
charge of student elections.

80
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:36,397
I am.

81
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:38,617
I'd like to run for class president.

82
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:40,270
Really?

83
00:03:40,272 --> 00:03:41,837
Really.

84
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:43,622
Okay.

85
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:46,363
You can sign up, but
I have to warn you...

86
00:03:46,365 --> 00:03:49,227
You'll be running
against Nell Cavanaugh.

87
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,498
So?

88
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,240
She's well-liked by the student body.

89
00:03:53,242 --> 00:03:54,328
So?

90
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:57,633
These elections tend to be a
bit of a popularity contest.

91
00:03:57,636 --> 00:04:00,725
- So?
- You're gonna make me say it, huh?

92
00:04:00,728 --> 00:04:01,944
Say what?

93
00:04:01,946 --> 00:04:03,571
People don't like you.

94
00:04:03,574 --> 00:04:06,556
Well, as my meemaw likes to
say, water off a duck's back.

95
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:08,777
Elections shouldn't be about popularity.

96
00:04:08,779 --> 00:04:11,388
They should be about
who has the best ideas.

97
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,695
And what's your idea?

98
00:04:13,697 --> 00:04:15,088
Less money on football,

99
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,439
more on science.

100
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:19,527
Really.
